Using **VELOCIraptor**
######################

.. _running:

Running the code
================

**Velociraptor** is a stand alone executable (with the executable named stf (or STructure Finder for historical reasons)).
It can be run in serial, with OpenMP, or MPI APIs. A typical command to start the code looks like:
::

 ./stf < args >

When compiled with OpenMP, setting the environment variable ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` will set the number of threads in the openmp sections.

With MPI using 8 MPI threads:
::

 mpirun -np 8 ./stf < args >

where here we assume that the parallel
environment uses the ``mpirun`` command to start MPI
applications. Depending on the operating system, other commands may be
required for this task, e.g. ``srun`` on some Cray machines. Note that
the code can in principle be started using an arbitrary number of
mpi threads, but the mpi decomposition is most efficient for powers of 2.

The output produced by VELOCIraptor will typically consist of several files containing:
bulk properties of structures found; particles belonging to these structures; and several
additional files containing configuration information.

When running in MPI, currently each mpi thread writes its own output unless
the code has been compiled with a parallel HDF5 library and HDF5 output is requested.
In that case, a single file is written containing data from all threads for each type
of output requested.

.. note:: At the moment, mpirun assumes that a single structure can fit onto the memory local to the mpi thread. If larger field objects (haloes) are to beanalyzed such that they are unlikely to fit into local memory, it is suggested another machine be used. Revision is in the works to use the Singlehalo_search option after field halos have been identified.

.. _cmdargs:

Arguments
---------

The code has several command line arguements. To list the arguments, type
::

    ./stf -?

.. topic:: The arguments that can be passed are:

    **-i** ``< file name of input file >``

    **-s** ``< number of files over which input is split >``

    **-I** ``< input format [1 Gadget, 2 HDF5, 3 Tipsy, 4 RAMSES, 5 NCHILADA] >``

    **-Z** ``< number of files to read in parallel (when mpi is invoked) >``

    **-o** ``< output base name (this can be overwritten by a configuration option in the config file. Suggestion would be to not use this option in the config file, use explicit command>``

    **-C** ``< configuration file name (see`` :ref:`configoptions` ``) >``

Of these arguements, only an input file and an output name must be provided.
In such a case, it is assumed that there is only 1 input file, 1 read mpi thread,
and default values for all other confirguration options. We suggest you do NOT run the code in this fashion.
Instead we suggest the code be run with at least a configuration file passed.
::

    ./stf -i input -o output -C configfile.txt

This configuration file is an ascii file that lists keywords and values.
A list of keywords, along with a description is presented below in :ref:`configoptions`.
A more typical command for a large cosmological simulation might be something like
::

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
    mpirun -np 64 ./stf -i somehdfbasename -s 128 -I 2 -Z 64 -o output -C configfile.txt > stf.log

.. _swiftintegration:

Running within swiftsim
-----------------------

|vr| is also able to be called from within an N-body/Hydrodynamnical code as a library.
Currently the code has been integrated in to **swifsim**. Details can be found
in the **swiftsim** `documentation <http://icc.dur.ac.uk/swift/docs/index.html>`_.
The key is that the **swiftsim** code's configuration file  lists the |vr| configuration file
used to run |vr|.

.. _briefoutput:

Output
------

Here we provide a *brief* description of the standard data products provided by |vr|.
For a more detailed discussion and some sample analysis using these data products see :ref:`output`.

When operating in a typical configuration with typical compile time options,
the executable (or each mpi thread) will produce several files (with the mpi
threads appending their rank to the end of the file name, unless parallel HDF5 output is requested).
The files typically produced are :

.. topic:: Output files

    * ``.properties``: a file containing the bulk properties of all structures identified.
    * ``.catalog_groups``: a file containing the size of the structures (in number of particles associated) & information need to read particle information produced by velociraptor
    * ``.catalog_particles``: a file containing a list of particle IDs of those in structures. Information contained in ``.catalog_groups`` is used to parse this data.
    * ``.catalog_particles.unbound``: similar to ``catalog_particles`` but lists particles in structures but are formally unbound. Information contained in ``.catalog_groups`` is used to parse this data.

.. topic:: Extra output files

    * ``.profiles``: a file containing the radial mass profiles of (sub)halos
    * ``.catalog_parttypes``: a file similar to ``.catalog_particles`` but stores particle type instead of paricle id.
    * ``.catalog_parttypes.unbound``: a file similar to ``.catalog_parttypes`` but for unbound particles.
    * ``.extendedinfo``: a file containing extra information on where particles are located in the input file for quick extraction from said input file of particles within groups. Still in alpha
    * ``.catalog_SOlist``: a file containing particle IDs within the spherical overdensity region of halos.

.. _configoptions:

Configuration File
------------------

An example configuration file can be found the examples directory within the repository
(see for instance :download:`sample <../examples/sample_dmcosmological_run.cfg>`).
This sample file lists all the options. *Only the keywords listed here will be used, all other words/characters are ignored*. One can check the options used by examining **foo.configuration**, where **foo** is your base output filename.

We suggest the following files as a basis:
    * :download:`N-body simulations configuration <../examples/sample_dmcosmological_6dfof_subhalo.cfg>`
        * This config file is for running a pure N-body simulation, producing 6dfof halos, find substructure and then calculating a variety of properties for each object. The reference position about which quantities are calculated is the minimum potential of an object. Substructure are subhalos, required to be approximately self-bound (particles allowed to have potential energy 0.95 times that of the kinetic energy). There are also similar config files that use :download:`3dfof halos <../examples/sample_dmcosmological_3dfof_subhalo.cfg>`, one setup to also find :download:`unbound tidal debris <../examples/sample_dmcosmological_3dfof_subhalo_tidal_debris.cfg>`.
    * :download:`Hydro simulations configuration <../examples/sample_hydrocosmological_run.cfg>`
        * This config is setup to load in all particles from a hydro sim and calculate a variety of quantities. It is similar to the N-body sample.
    * :download:`SWIFT N-body simulation configuration <../examples/sample_swiftdm_3dfof_subhalo.cfg>`
        * This config is setup to load in a swift snapshot. It is similar to the N-body sample but here is using 3dfof halos.
    * :download:`SWIFT Hydro simulation configuration <../examples/sample_swifthydro_3dfof_subhalo_extra_properties.cfg>`
        * This config is setup to load in a swift hydro snapshot and also load in extra information from the snapshot to calculate extra hydro/star/bh quantitites. Another example of such a config with specific black hole related quantities is also :download:`available <../examples/sample2_swifthydro_3dfof_subhalo_extra_properties.cfg>`.

Also provided are config files for the :download:`SURFS <../examples/surfs2018_configuration.cfg>` and :download:GENESIS<../examples/genesis2019_configuration.cfg> simulations.

.. warning:: Note that if misspell a keyword it will not be used.
.. warning:: Since this file is always written **DO NOT** name your input configuration file **foo.configuration**.

            - **2** field search also altered to treat baryons differently, allowing only DM particles to be used as head links (ie link dm-dm, dm-baryon, but not baryon-baryon nor baryon-dm). Then DM substructure search with baryons associated to closest DM particle in phase-space. **Recommended**.
            - **1** field search run as normal and then substructure search for baryons run using baryons identified in field search.
            - **0** do nothing special for baryon particles.
    ``Search_for_substructure = 1/0``
        * Flag indicating whether field objects are searched for internal substructures. Default is 1 (on)
    ``Singlehalo_search_search = 0/1``
        * Flag indicates that no field search is going to be run and the entire volume will be treated as a background region (halo). Useful if searching for substructures in non-cosmological simulations. But can also be co-opted for other searches using different outlier criteria and FOF algorithms

    ``Halo_velocity_linking_length_factor = 1.0``
        * Multiplicative factor of order unity for the dispersions used in 6D searches. Typical values are order unity as velocity dispersions are used to define the velocity linking length scale.

    ``Minimum_halo_size =-1``
        * Integer that allows field objects (or so-called halos) to require a different minimum size than all other substructures. Ignored if not passed or <0, with halos defaulting to ``Minimum_size`` value.

.. _config_sub_search:

        * Flag indicating whether particles are moved to the rough CM velocity frame of the background before substructures are searched for (default is on)
    ``Iterative_searchflag = 1/0``

    ``Iterative_linking_length_factor = 2.0``
        * Factor multiplied with linking length when using iterative method and identifying outlier regions associated with the initial candidate list of spatially compact outlier groups. Typical values are order ``Halo_linking_length_factor`` (2.0)

.. _config_core_search:

.. topic:: Configuration for core search and growth.

    This either identifies major mergers in DM simulations or used to find galaxies when searching for stars.

    ``Halo_core_search = 0/1/2``
        * Integer allows one to explicitly search for large 6D FOF cores that are indicative of a recent major merger. Since substructure is defined on the scale of the maximum cell size and major mergers typically result two or more phase-space dense regions that are *larger* than the cell size used in reasonable substructure searches, one can identify them using this search. The overall goal is to treat these objects differently than a substructure. However, if 2 is set, then smaller core is treated as substructure and all particles within the FOF envelop are assigned to the cores based on their phase-space distance to core particles.
            - **2** search for cores and growth them. **Recommended**.
            - **1**
            - **0** do not search cores.
    ``Use_adaptive_core_search = 0/1``
        * Flag allows one to run complex adaptive phase-space search for large 6D FOF cores and then use these linking lengths to separate mergers. 0 is simple high density dispersively cold cores with velocity scale adaptive, 1 is adaptive in both configuration & velocity.
    ``Use_phase_tensor_core_growth = 0/1``
        * Flag allows one to run complex phase-space growth of merger remnants (6D FOF cores found). 0 is assignment with simple x and v dispersion to nearest core particle, 1 is phase-space tensor distance assignemnt to CM of core.
    ``Halo_core_ellx_fac =``
        * Factor applied to linking length when identifying merger remnants. Typically values are 0.5
    ``Halo_core_ellv_fac =``
        * Factor applied to local dispersion to define the velocity scale used to identify merger remnants. Typically values are order unity
    ``Halo_core_ncellfac = 0.005``
        * Factor used to determine the minimum number of particles a merger remnants is composed of using number of particles in the halo times this factor. For DM typically values are 0.005.
    ``Halo_core_adaptive_sigma_fac = 2.0``
        * Factor used when running fully adaptive core search, specifies the width of the physical linking length in configuration space dispersion (think of this as how many sigma to include). Typically values are 2. This has been tested on hydrodynamnical simulations to separate galaxy mergers.
    ``Halo_core_num_loops = 10``
        * Allows the core search to iterate, shrinking linking lengths used till the number of cores identified reaches zero or this limit is reached. Allows apative search with larger linking length to be robust.  Typically values are 10, though typically loops run twice.
    ``Halo_core_loop_ellx_fac = 0.75``
        * Factor by which configuration linking length is decreased when running loops for core search.  Typically values are 0.75
    ``Halo_core_loop_ellv_fac = 1.0``
        * Factor by which velocity linking length is decreased when running loops for core search.  Typically values are 1.
    ``Halo_core_loop_elln_fac = 1.2``
        * Factor by which min group size is changed when running loops for core search.  Typically values are order unity & > 1.
    ``Halo_core_phase_significance = 2.0``
        * Significance a core must be in terms of phase-space distance scaled by dispersions (sigma). Typical values are order unity & > 1.

.. topic:: Configuration for cleaning up substructuers that overlap in phase-space.

    Substructures can be merged together if they overlap in phase space.

    ``Structure_phase_merge_dist = 0.25``
        * Phase-distance normalised by dispersions below which structures are merged together. Typical valuse are < 1.
    ``Apply_phase_merge_to_host = 1``
        * Flag whether to also check substructures can be merged with the host background. 1 is on.

Particles in strutures can be checked to see if they are bound relative to a kinetic reference frame (CM of the structure).
This cleans the (sub)structures of spurious objects and particles.

    ``Unbind_flag = 1/0``
        * Flag indciating whether substructures passed through an unbinding routine.
    ``Unbinding_type = 1/0``
        * Integer setting the unbinding criteria used. Either just remove particles deemeed "unbound" (**1**), that is those with :math:`\alpha T+W>0` given by ``Allowed_kinetic_potential_ratio``, or (**0**) additionally removes "unbound" and least bound particles till system also has a true bound fraction > ``Min_bound_mass_frac``.
    ``Allowed_kinetic_potential_ratio =``
        * Ratio of kinetic to potential energy at which a particle is still considered bound, ie: particle is still bound if :math:`\alpha T+W<0`, so :math:`\alpha=1` would be standard unbinding and :math:`\alpha<1` allows one to identify unbound tidal debris. Given that **VELOCIraptor** was designed to identify tidal streams, it makes little sense to have this set to 1 unless explicitly required. Note that the code still separates particles into bound and unbound. Values of :math:`\alpha\geq 0.2` seems to minimize the number of false positives in tidal debris while still identifying completely unbound tidal debris.
    ``Min_bound_mass_frac =``
        * Minimum fraction of particles that must be self-bound. If interested in identifying tidal debris, ues values of 0.2, for self-bound substructures, use :math:`\gtrsim 0.5`
    ``Bound_halos = 0/1/2``
        * Integer that ignores the boundness of field structures (haloes) (**0**), checks if they are self bound only before (**1**) or also after (**2**) substructures have been identified and extracted from the halo. Demanding boundness after substructure search can have interesting consequences as it is possible that a multiple merger will appear as a single FOF halo, however all with all the cores removed, the FOF halo is actually an unbound structure.
    ``Keep_background_potential = 1/0``
        * Flag indicating whether while checking if a structure is bound, to treat the candidate structure in isolation, updating the potential continuously, or leave the background potential.  background sea. When finding tidal debris, it is useful to keep the background. \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.bgpot \n
    ``Kinetic_reference_frame_type = 0/1``
        * Integer that sets the kinetic frame when determining whether particle is bound. Default is to use the centre-of-mass velocity frame (0) but can also use region around minimum of the potential (1).
    ``Min_npot_ref = 10``
        * The minimum number of particles used to calculate the velocity of the minimum of the potential (default is 10).
    ``Frac_pot_ref = 0.1``
        * Fraction of particles used to calculate the velocity of the minimum of the potential (0.1). If smaller than ``Min_npot_ref``, that is used.
    ``Unbinding_max_unbound_removal_fraction_per_iteration = 0.5``
        * Maximum fraction of unbound particles removed per iteration in unbinding process.
    ``Unbinding_max_unbound_fraction = 0.95``
        * Maximum fraction of particles that can be considered unbound before group removed entirely and is not processed iteratively.
    ``Unbinding_max_unbound_fraction_allowed = 0.005``
        * Maximum fraction of unbound particles allowed after unbinding. If set to zero, all unbound particles removed.
    ``Approximate_potential_calculation = 1/0``
        * Calculate potentials using significantly faster approximate method (which with standard settings has an erorr 1e-3). Default is 0 (off).
    ``Approximate_potential_calculation_particle_number_fraction = 0.1``
        * Use 0.1 of all particles in object to calculate gravitational potential (values of <0.01 can lead to larger errors, values of >0.2 cause calculation to not be significantly faster than standard calculation).
    ``Approximate_potential_calculation_min_particle = 5000``
        * Use a minimum of 5000 particles in approximate method. Approximate method should only be used for well resolved objects as error increases with less well resolved objects and the speed up is not as significant.

.. topic:: Configuration for Extra Properties

    These are configuration options related to the bulk properties calculated based on extra
    properties of the particles. For instance, if hydro particles have a field called ``Turbulence``
    that contains some quantity of the internal turbulent energy and one wanted to calculate the
    average of this value for an object, one would use these options to load data from an HDF5 file
    (other inputs are not so easily parsed, making this not an option). One needs to provide what calculation
    to do (in the form of an integer flag specifying the calculation) and a string indicating the units.
    If the input is in the form of a 2D array from which a particular column is to be used, one can also
    set an index. The result is sorted in an output field that contains the name of the input field,
    the index (if >0), and a simple string describing the function and ending with particle type,
    ie: ``Turbulence_average_gas``
    These config options are combinations of particle type, categories and entry types.
    A full entry must be provided in a comma separated list and terminate in a comma.

    * Currently implemented are options for
        * ``Gas_``
        * ``Stars_``
        * ``BH_``
        *  ``Extra_DM_``
    * The currently catagories of properties are (except for ``Extra_DM`` which only has the first listed). An input field can be specified a number of times with different desired calculations to be run.
        * ``_internal_property``
        * ``_chemistry``
        * ``_chemistry_production``
    * The entries are
        * ``_names``
        * ``_index_in_file``
        * ``_calculation_type``
        * ``_input_output_unit_conversion_factors``
        * ``_output_units``

    Calculations allowed are as follows. You can add **massweighted** to any
    entry to calculate the mass weighted quantity. Note at entries should be lower case.
        * average
        * total
        * std (standard deviation)
        * min
        * max
        * logaverage (average(log(x)))
        * logstd (std(log(x)))

    Output units are indices of standard units separated by colons along with any additional
    extra units which are added as strings to the name of the output. The standard units
    for which indices can be provided are
        * Mass (where conversion to solar mass provided can be used to convert output to known units)
        * Length (where conversion to kpc provided can be used to convert output to known units)
        * Velocity (where conversion to km/s provided can be used to convert output to known units)
        * Time (where conversion to Gyrs provided can be used to convert output to known units)
    Thus to specify mass per unit time^2 and another entry with force, as an example, one would use a string of
        * "1:0:0:-2:,1:0:1:-1:,"

    This does require the input to be converted appropriately to match the units of mass, length, velocity, time.
    This attribute information will be stored the attributes associated with the data set, similar to other fields.
    One can also provide complex units with a string that will be stored in a attribute **Dimension_Extra_Info**
        * "cookies_per_person,"

    One can also calculate total or average in apertures provided aperture
    quantities are being calculated.
        * aperture_total
        * aperture_average

    Example extra hydro Properties related config options
        ``Gas_internal_property_names = ,``
            * Names of fields to be read from an input HDF5 file that relate to hydro quantities, for which calculations can be done
        ``Gas_internal_property_index_in_file = ,``
            * Index in 2d array to be read from an input HDF5, useful for fields like metallicity where it is common to have an entry for each element
        ``Gas_internal_property_calculation_type = ,``
            * Integer flag indicating what calculation is to be done.
        ``Gas_internal_property_input_output_unit_conversion_factors = ,``
            * Float storing the conversion factor (if not 1.0) to take input units to output units.
        ``Gas_internal_property_output_units = ,``
            * String storing the units of the output.
