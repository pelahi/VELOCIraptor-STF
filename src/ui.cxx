    Only the keywords listed here will be used, all other words/characters are ignored.
    Note that if misspell a keyword it will not be used. One can check the options used by examining <b><em>foo</em>.configuration</b>,
    where <em>foo</em> is your base output filename \ref Options.outname. This file lists all the options. Since this file is
    always written <b><em>DO NOT</em></b> name your input configuration file <b><em>foo</em>.configuration</b>.

    There are numerous key words that can be passed to change the values stored in \ref Options. Here we list them

    \subsection foffieldconfig Configuration for field search
    \arg <b> \e FoF_Field_search_type </b> There are several FOF criteria implemented to search for so-called field objects (see \ref FOFTYPES for more types and \ref fofalgo.h for implementation) \ref Options.fofbgtype \n
        - \b 5 \e standard 3D FOF based algorithm
        - \b 4 \e standard 3D FOF based algorithm <b> FOLLOWED </b> by 6D FOF search using the velocity scale defined by the largest halo on <b> ONLY </b> particles in 3DFOF groups

    \arg <b> \e Minimum_halo_size </b> Allows field objects (or so-called halos) to require a different minimum size (typically would be <= \ref Options.MinSize. Default is -1 which sets it to \ref Options.MinSize) \ref Options.HaloMinSize \n
    \arg <b> \e Halo_linking_length_factor </b> allows one to use different physical linking lengths between field objects and substructures.  (Typically for 3DFOF searches of dark matter haloes, set to value such that this times \ref Options.ellphys = 0.2 the interparticle spacing when examining cosmological simulations ) \ref Options.ellhalophysfac \n
    \arg <b> \e Halo_velocity_linking_length_factor </b> allows one to use different velocity linking lengths between field objects and substructures when using 6D FOF searches.  (Since in such cases the general idea is to use the local velocity dispersion to define a scale, \f$ \geq5 \f$ times this value seems to correctly scale searches) \ref Options.ellhalovelfac \n

    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_search </b> 0/1/2 flag allows one to explicitly search for large 6D FOF cores that are indicative of a recent major merger. Since substructure is defined on the scale of the maximum cell size and major mergers typically result two or more phase-space dense regions that are \e larger than the cell size used in reasonable substructure searches, one can identify them using this search. The overall goal is to treat these objects differently than a substructure. However, if 2 is set, then smaller core is treated as substruture and all particles within the FOF envelop are assigned to the cores based on their phase-space distance to core particles \ref Options.iHaloCoreSearch \n
    \arg <b> \e Use_adaptive_core_search </b> 0/1 flag allows one to run complex adaptive phase-space search for large 6D FOF cores and then use these linking lengths to separate mergers. 0 is simple high density dispersively cold cores with v scale adaptive, 1 is adaptive with simple dispersions in both x and v.
    \arg <b> \e Use_phase_tensor_core_growth </b> 0/1 flag allows one to run complex phase-space growth of merger remnants (6D FOF cores found). 0 is assignment with simple x and v dispersion to nearest core particle, 1 is phase-space tensor distance assignemnt to CM of core.
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_ellx_fac </b> scaling applied to linking length when identifying merger remnants. Typically values are \f$ \sim0.5 \f$  \ref Options.halocorexfac
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_ellv_fac </b> scaling applied to local dispersion to define the velocity scale used to identify merger remnants. Typically values are \f$ \sim1 \f$  \ref Options.halocorevfac
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_ncellfac </b> used to determine the minimum number of particles a merger remnants is composed of, specifically \f$ N_{\rm min}= f_{\rm ncell}* N_{\rm S} \f$. Typically values are 0.005
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_adaptive_sigma_fac </b> used when running fully adaptive core search, specifies the width of the physical linking length in configuration space dispersion (think of this as how many sigma to include). Typically values are \f$ \sim2 \f$. This has been tested on hydrodynamnical simulations to separate galaxy mergers. \ref Options.halocoresigmafac
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_num_loops </b> allows the core search to iterate, shrinking the velocity linking length to used till the number of cores identified decreases or this limit is reached. Allows apative search with larger linking length to be robust.  Typically values are \f$ \sim5 \f$ with loops only running often twice. \ref Options.halocorenumloops.
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_loop_ellx_fac </b> Factor by which configuration linking length is decreased when running loops for core search.  Typically values are \f$ \sim0.75 \f$. \ref Options.halocorexfaciter
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_loop_ellv_fac </b> Factor by which velocity linking length is decreased when running loops for core search.  Typically values are \f$ \sim0.75 \f$. \ref Options.halocorevfaciter
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_loop_elln_fac </b> Factor by which min group size is changed when running loops for core search.  Typically values are \f$ \sim1.25 \f$. \ref Options.halocorenumfaciter
    \arg <b> \e Halo_core_phase_significance </b> Significance a core must be in terms of phase-space distance scaled by dispersions (sigma).

    \section unbindconfig Unbinding Parameters
    See \ref unbinding and \ref unbind.cxx for more details

    \arg <b> \e Unbind_flag  </b> whether or not substructures should be passed through an unbinding routine. \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.unbindflag \n
    \arg <b> \e Allowed_kinetic_potential_ratio  </b> ratio of kinetic to potential energy at which a particle is still considered bound, ie: particle is still bound
    if \f$ \alpha T+W<0 \f$, so \f$ \alpha=1 \f$ would be standard unbinding and \f$ \alpha<1 \f$ allows one to identify unbound tidal debris.
    Given that <b> VELOCIraptor </b> was designed to identify tidal streams, it makes little sense to have this set to 1 unless explicitly required.
    Note that the code still separates particles into bound and unbound. Typical values of \f$ \alpha\geq 0.2 \f$ seems to minimize the number of false positives
    in tidal debris while still identifying completely unbound tidal debris. \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.Eratio \n
    \arg <b> \e Min_bound_mass_frac </b> Designed to demand a substructure still have a minimum amount of self-bound mass. \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.minEfrac \n
    \arg <b> \e Bound_halos </b> 0/1/2 flag to make sure field objects such as haloes are self bound before (use 1) and also after (use 2) substructures have been identified
    and extracted from the halo. Demanding boundness after substructure search can have interesting consequences as it is possible that a multiple merger will appear as
    a single FOF halo, however all with all the cores removed, the FOF halo is actually an unbound structure. \ref Options.iBoundHalos \n
    \arg <b> \e Keep_background_potential </b> 1/0 flag When determining whether a structure is self-bound, the approach taken is to treat the candidate structure in isolation. Then determine the velocity reference frame to determine the kinetic energy of each particle and remove them. However, it is possible one wishes to keep the background particles when determining the potential, that is once one starts unbinding, don't treat the candidate structure in isolation but in a background sea. When finding tidal debris, it is useful to keep the background. \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.bgpot \n
    \arg <b> \e Kinetic_reference_frame_type </b> specify kinetic frame when determining whether particle is bound.
    Default is to use the centre-of-mass velocity frame (0) but can also use region around minimum of the potential (1). \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.cmvelreftype \n
    \arg <b> \e Min_npot_ref </b> Set the minimum number of particles used to calculate the velocity of the minimum of the potential (10). \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.Npotref \n
    \arg <b> \e Frac_pot_ref </b> Set the fraction of particles used to calculate the velocity of the minimum of the potential (0.1). \ref Options.uinfo & \ref UnbindInfo.fracpotref \n
    \arg <b> \e Unbinding_type </b> Set the unbinding criteria, either just remove particles deemeed "unbound", that is those with \f$ \alpha T+W>0\f$, choosing \ref UPART. Or with \ref USYSANDPART
    removes "unbound" particles till system also has a true bound fraction > \ref UnbindInfo.minEfrac.
